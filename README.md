# Perfect numbers

This repo contains a re-typed copy of 

>Terry Tao, _Perfect Numbers_, Trigon (School Mathematics Journal of the Mathematical Association of South Australia) **21** (3), Nov. 1983, p. 7.

Along with a working copy of the C64 BASIC code therein. The code as presented in the article has a typo, and also uses a PETSCII character not found in our modern ASCII-based character set (the 'up arrow' â†‘ in the original code occupies the same position as our modern caret ^), so the code files are not identical to that in the article.

## Running the code

You will need a C64 emulator or similar. I tested the code on my Mac using https://github.com/mist64/cbmbasic
